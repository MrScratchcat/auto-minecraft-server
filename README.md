# auto-minecraft-server
this script is for ubuntu server and ubuntu desktop and i think that it can run on more linux distro's as long it is debian based 

put the scrip in a folder where you want your minecraft server to be in and to activate the server creator you need to put in this command: bash minecraft_server_creator.sh

all in one:
git clone https://github.com/MrScratchcat/auto-minecraft-server && cd auto-minecraft-server/ && bash minecraft_server_creator.sh
